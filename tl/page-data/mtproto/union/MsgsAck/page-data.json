If a response is a long time coming, a server may first send a receipt acknowledgment, and somewhat later, the RPC response itself.\nA client normally acknowledges the receipt of a message from a server (usually, an RPC response) by adding an acknowledgment to the next RPC query if it is not transmitted too late (if it is generated, say, 60-120 seconds following the receipt of a message from the server). However, if for a long period of time there is no reason to send messages to the server or if there is a large number of unacknowledged messages from the server (say, over 16), the client transmits a stand-alone acknowledgment.</div>\n"}]},"usageMethods":{"nodes":[]},"usageTypes":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"prefix":"mtproto/","name":"MsgsAck","type":"union","namespace":"$root","subtypes":["msgs_ack"],"hasSubtypes":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["3577901480"]}
