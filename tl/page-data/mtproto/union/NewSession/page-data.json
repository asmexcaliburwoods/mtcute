No such notifications are generated for high msg_id values.\nThis notification must be acknowledged by the client. It is necessary, for instance, for the client to understand that there is, in fact, a “gap” in the stream of notifications received from the server (the user may have failed to receive notifications during some period of time).\nClient should also resend all the messages that were sent before <code>firstMsgId</code></div>\n"}]},"usageMethods":{"nodes":[]},"usageTypes":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"prefix":"mtproto/","name":"NewSession","type":"union","namespace":"$root","subtypes":["new_session_created"],"hasSubtypes":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["3577901480"]}
